"Habitat","https://www.linkedin.com/company/habitat_2/","http://www.habitat.co.uk","Habitat is an iconic homeware and furniture retailer that was launched on the British high street in 1964, and has been challenging the way people style and shop for their homes ever since. Habitat continues to create good design that’s useful, affordable and distinctive. 

We recognise that today there are more brands than ever selling furniture, but here’s why we’re still going strong: 

Original design is the most important thing we do – Almost every Habitat product has been created by a Habitat designer; hours of work go into making each piece useful, beautiful and long-lasting.

We reach every corner of the world – We’ve always travelled the world to find the best partners and to be inspired by how other people live.  

We’re committed to quality at every price point – No matter how small or how big the piece, we apply rigorous quality standards to everything we sell.  We obsess over materials, finishes and construction so our customers can be confident their new product is fit for purpose, well designed and fairly priced.

We’re accessible to all – We have three London showrooms, Minis across the country, a collection at 900+ stockists, and hassle-free delivery throughout the UK.

We’ve been imagining life as it should be since 1964 – From the wok to the duvet, paper pendants to chicken bricks, and all our iconic catalogues in between, Habitat has had a unique and prolific impact on the way the British live.

We’re always interested to hear from people who live and breathe great design, and who want to partner with or be part of a progressive and original accessories, homeware and furniture brand.  

So give us a shout if you’re a motivated and inspired because we like thinkers who are both commercial and creative. 

We’re here – just as we have been, for half a century.","https://linkedin.com/in/nick-zinovkin-050b1083","invalid","proxycurl scraping error"

"Qumulo","https://www.linkedin.com/company/qumulo/","http://www.qumulo.com","Modern enterprises have to manage exponentially-growing petabyte-scale data stores comprised mostly of unstructured data. Someone (often IT) has the difficult job of staying on top of managing these data stores, which becomes more difficult to do as enterprise datasets expand from the data center to the edge and cloud. And while scale and complexity are rising, budgets and staff are not.

Existing solutions suffer from two crucial shortcomings: Complexity and platform lock-in. Legacy solutions are excruciatingly complex to deploy and manage. And nearly every solution restricts users to running in only the data center and on expensive, inflexible proprietary hardware platforms.

Qumulo is the simple way to manage exabyte-scale data anywhere — edge, core, or cloud — on the platform of your choice. In a world with trillions of files and objects comprising 100+ zettabytes worldwide, companies need a solution that combines the ability to work anywhere with simplicity.

The Tray Platform removes these limitations, empowering both non-technical and technical users to create sophisticated workflow automations that streamline data movement and actions across multiple applications.

But we're about practicality and doing things that actually make a difference in your life and the way you live.

For instance, you're probably a lot more interested in knowing that Meritage builds new, beautifully designed, energy-efficient homes that can save you as much as 50% on your utility bills.* Or, that we were the first national top 10 homebuilder to have every home we build be 100% ENERGY STAR certified. That means it saves you energy and money.

With more than 100,000 homes built, our focus, since day one, has been to build incredible new homes and communities in prime locations for fantastic prices. We build them for real people: People with families and those without; people with everyday, busy lives, and those who are now enjoying a more relaxed lifestyle. But more than anything, we build energy-efficient homes and communities for people who appreciate a home being built the way it can, and should, be built. For you it means having a new home that comes standard with ENERGY STAR features that save money and energy, month after month, at no extra cost to you.

Our MISSION STATEMENT:
To design and build homes that are innovative,
built with care and superior craftsmanship,
which deliver enduring value.

"New Belgium Brewing","https://www.linkedin.com/company/new-belgium-brewing-company/","https://www.newbelgium.com/","New Belgium Brewing was founded in 1991 in Fort Collins, Colo., by Kim Jordan, a social worker, who built her company the only way a social worker would: People first. Over the past three decades, New Belgium has turned that ethos into a unique “human-powered” business model through practices that were and still are rare in the business world: fully paid healthcare premiums for all coworkers, paying a living wage, open-book management, renewable energy sourcing, a free onsite medical clinic and physician, a deep commitment to philanthropy and advocacy, and much more. With expansions to Asheville, N.C., in 2016; Denver, Colo., in 2018; San Francisco in 2021; and the 2021 acquisition of Bell’s Brewery, based in Kalamazoo, Mich., this people-centric model has led New Belgium to become arguably the most popular and fastest-growing American craft brewer today. New Belgium is famous for its flagship beer, Fat Tire Amber Ale; year-round favorites like Voodoo Ranger IPA (America’s #1 IPA brand), Dominga Mimosa Sour, and La Folie Sour Brown Ale; and an award-winning wood-aged sour program and innovative limited release beers.","https://linkedin.com/in/shauna-cobb-phr-shrm-cp-2a394743","invalid","proxycurl scraping error"

"Vanguard Australia","https://www.linkedin.com/company/vanguard-australia","http://www.vanguard.com.au","Over 40 years ago, a great idea was born—that an investment firm should operate solely in the interests of all investors to give them the best chance of success.

In 1975, John ""Jack"" Bogle launched a bold experiment: an investment company that was designed to make money for its investors, not from them. He structured Vanguard in the US to be owned by its funds, with no external shareholders all profits would be reinvested in the business and returned to fund investors in the form of lower costs. 

Through an investment philosophy based on fairness and transparency that great idea grew and grew. And as we’ve grown, we’ve continually reduced our costs and passed the savings back to investors. 

In 1996 the idea made its way to Australia. And we’ve been changing the way Australians invest ever since by providing low-cost, high-value investments to help you keep more of your returns.
